<p class="title">Msocial-Facebook for Facebook’s Privacy Policy</p>
<p>Msocial-Facebook is a plugin for Moodle providing registered users of Facebook to use the posts and interactions in classroom and educational activities and academical research (“Services”).</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how and when Msocial-Facebook collects, uses and shares your information when you use our Services.
Msocial-Facebook receives your information only through Facebook APIs.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:jpdecastro@tel.uva.es">jpdecastro@tel.uva.es</a>.</p>

<p class="title">Information Collection and Use</p>
<p>We collect and use your information below to provide our Services and to measure and improve our Services from time to time.</p>
<ul>
<li>We only collect the posts you make in the Group that your teacher has designated to hold the educational activity.</li>
<li>We do not collect information about your friends nor activities outside the designated group.</li>
<li>We only use your permissions to check that group and never publish anything on your behalf. Never will ask you for that.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="title">Information Sharing and Disclosure</span><br>
<p>We do not disclose your private personal information. All the records are held in your University database and used only to give the Services.</p>
<p><span class="title">How to access your personal data rights: How to remove my data</span><br>
<p>We will process your personal data for as long as it is necessary and proportionate for the purpose for
	which it has been supplied and we will store the personal data for the shortest amount of time possible, taking into
	account legal and service requirements.
MSocial is integrated into Moodle's privacy architecture and, hence,
	Moodle's privacy tools are applied.
	You can request the removal of all your data using the opt-out tool available in the "Data requests" option of your profile menu.
Also, without your intervention, your data is automatically removed after the legitimate use of the data is over: the course is removed, reseted or your user is deleted from your Moodle server.</p>

<p><span class="title">Law and Harm</span></p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably
necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Msocial-Facebook's rights or property.
 However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party, including a government, request to disclose your information.</p>
<p><span class="title">Non-Private or Non-Personal Information</span></p>
	<p> We won't share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information,
such as your public user profile information, the people you share your information with, or the number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did),
except to your teachers in the context of the MSocial activity and further academical analysis.</p>

<p><span class="title">Changes to this Policy</span></p>
<p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at
http://yourelearningserver/<a href="mod/msocial/connector/Facebook/legal/privacypolicy.html">mod/msocial/connector/facebook/legal/privacypolicy.html</a>.
If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material,
we will update that document.
By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Effective: 7st May 2018</p>
